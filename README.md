# Focus On Results Atlanta
### City Performance Metrics
================
This repository is for display and visualization of City performance data as tracked by FOR Atlanta. 

FOR Atlanta is housed in the Mayor’s Office of Innovation Delivery and Performance, and provides information that highlights some of the core metrics used to measure performance across the city. The site is grouped into two parts: one part contains information about Atlanta’s public safety departments - the Atlanta Police Department, Atlanta Fire Rescue Department, Department of Corrections, and Municipal Court - and another part dedicated to other operational departments.
