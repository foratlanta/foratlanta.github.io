      summary: This figure shows the total volume of all customer service requests that the Department of Watershed Management (DWM) receives on a monthly basis.

      note: In any given month, the "Total Service Requests" metric is defined as the sum of the number of Service Requests closed during the month and the number of Service Requests open as of the end of the month.  Volume is calculated this way to ensure that open Service Requests continue to count towards performance until they are closed. <br><br>Add or remove data points by clicking on the name in the index above.

    - title: Meter Investigation Service Requests
      summary: This figure measures the number of meter investigations carried out by DWM each month, and the Department’s performance in carrying out those investigations in a timely manner. Customers can request a meter investigation where they believe there is something wrong with their meter that is causing it to give false readings about the amount of water they are consuming. DWM’s target is to complete a meter investigation within 7 business days of the customer making the request.
      description: Since August 2014, performance has trended up. Meter investigations deal with a very small fraction of the more-than 150,000 meters that are installed across the city.

    - title: Street Flooding Inspection Service Requests
      summary: This figure measures DWM’s responsiveness to customer service calls about water pooling in city streets. Because this pooling can be a symptom of several different problems, the first course of action is always for Watershed staff to inspect the site and determine the root cause of the problem. DWM has a goal of responding to all such customer calls and initiating an inspection within 4 hours.
      description: The Department's performance has fluctuated between 60-80% each month. This metric is seasonal and volume tends to increase in rainier months.
