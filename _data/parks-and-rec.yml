      description: The number of Service Requests the Department receives tends to fluctuate seasonally betweem 1,000-2,000 per month.  Performance on completing these requests within target timeframes has shown a distinct upward trend since the start of 2014.
      note: In any given month, the "Total Service Requests" metric is defined as the sum of the number of Service Requests closed during the month and the number of Service Requests open as of the end of the month.
