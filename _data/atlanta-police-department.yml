    - title: Change in crime By Police Zone
      summary: APD organizes its field division into 6 administrative zones.  APD actively monitors changes and compares crime across these different zones as part of its improvement efforts.  The total YTD change in major crimes, as defined by the FBI, compared to the year before for each zone is shown below.
      description: YTD numbers in each zone tend to vary more in the first months of the year as smaller fluctuations have a larger impact on year-over-year comparisons. These numbers then tend to smooth out over the course of the year.
