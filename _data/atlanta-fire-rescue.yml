    - title: Fire Response Performance
      summary: Of all of the fire calls for service responded to in a given month, 90% of the time the responders were able to leave the station (turnout time) and arrive at the incident (first due response time) in the listed time or less. Data on response times are presented at the 90th percentile, which is consistent with the practices of the Commission on Fire Accreditation International.  A traditional “average” (mean, median or mode) does not give the best indication of the distribution of the data (i.e. outliers).
